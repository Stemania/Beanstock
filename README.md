# Beanstock
BeanStock is a desktop-based inventory management system built using Python and MySQL. It is designed to help coffee shops efficiently manage their stock and simplify day-to-day operations. The system was developed as a project for an Advanced Programming course.

To run the system correctly, make sure the following files are in the same folder: main.exe, main.py, login.py, database.py, and coffee_shop.db. Also, ensure that the img folder and the _internal folder are also present in the same directory. Once everything is in place, run main.exe to launch the system.
